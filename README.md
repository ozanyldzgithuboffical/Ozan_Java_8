# Ozan_Java_8
> This repo includes features and practices for Java 8 for the followings:

- **Lambda expressions** 
- The Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface.
- It is very useful in collection library in which it helps to iterate, filter and extract data.
- An interface which has only one abstract method is called **functional interface** .
- Java provides an anotation **@FunctionalInterface**, which is used to declare an interface as functional interface.

## Lambda Expression Sytax

```java
(Argument List) -> {body}
```
### Argument List
- It basically containes arguments for function
- It can be empty or non-empty

### Arrow Sign

- It links the arguments to function

### Body
